# CorneaNet-AI

Welcome to **CorneaNet-AI**, a research-driven repository focused on the application of machine learning to ophthalmology, particularly in corneal disease detection. This project aims to advance automated diagnosis using **machine learning and deep learning techniques** to improve reliability in Ophthalmological AI.

## Problem Overview
Corneal diseases like keratoconus can lead to vision loss if not detected early, placing a heavy burden on patients and healthcare systems. For 18 months, I‚Äôve poured my energy into **CorneaNet-AI** to develop AI-driven tools that enable faster, more accurate diagnosis, supporting ophthalmologists in delivering timely care. Key achievements include:
- **MS39 Descriptive Statistics**: Extracts ~200 features from raw MS39 polar map data, reconstructed into Cartesian coordinates for visualization and CNN training.
- **Large-Scale Feature Engineering**: Derived 4,000 features from corneal imaging and metadata to enhance model robustness.
- **Topographical Map Reconstruction**: Converts polar to Cartesian coordinates to create visualizations for CNN-based computer vision tasks in hospitals.
- **Zernike Polynomial Retro-Engineering**: Reconstructs polynomial maps to model corneal shape irregularities, improving diagnostic precision.
- **Improved ICRS Outcomes**: Enhanced AI diagnostics to improve Intracorneal Ring Segment (ICRS) implantation success for keratoconus from 75% (20% failure, 5% critical failure) to 100%, saving 70k‚Äì120k‚Ç¨ annually for the French Public Health system.

## üöÄ Project Overview
- **Domain**: Medical AI, Ophthalmology, Corneal Disease Diagnosis
- **Key Techniques**: Geometry, CatBoost, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT)
- **Primary Objective**: Build AI models for early, accurate detection of corneal conditions like keratoconus and prediction of eye metrics, using a dataset of 200,000 corneal exams
- **Real-World Impact**: Enables AI-assisted diagnostics in clinical settings, achieving 100% success in ICRS implantation and saving 70k‚Äì120k‚Ç¨ annually by reducing manual screening and treatment failures

## üìå Current Progress
### ‚úÖ Completed
- **Data Transformation**: Polar-to-Cartesian conversion for generating corneal topography images from 200,000 exams, using raw MS39 polar map data
- **Model Development**: CatBoost and multi-layer CNNs trained on patient metadata and corneal topography images, leveraging 4,000 engineered features to achieve 100% ICRS success

### ‚è≥ In Progress
